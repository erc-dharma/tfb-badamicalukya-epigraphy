                     <note>Fleet translates, “who allayed … the hostile … enemies of the gods.” I believe that <foreign>murāreḥ</foreign> is a much more likely restoration. As Fleet agrees, the subject must be a lost word meaning “the form”, and it is easily conceivable that <foreign>loka-bharttuḥ</foreign> is in apposition to the possessor of that “form” in the genitive. The line may have run something like <foreign>praśamita-ripu-śakti kroḍa-rūpaṁ murāreḥ</foreign>, but I prefer not to show such a conjectural restoration in the text.</note>

                     <note>The gap does not seem to be wide enough for <foreign>ghā</foreign> (unless it was compressed horizontally), although there may have been three vertical strokes in this glyph. From the vestiges, the consonant <foreign>p</foreign> seems more likely, but <foreign>vipāta</foreign> is not attested, though <foreign>vi-pat</foreign> “burst asunder” is. The vowel may well be <foreign>ā</foreign>, though <foreign>o</foreign> and <foreign>ī</foreign> are also quite conceivable. See the commentary for further speculation.</note>

                    <note>Fleet prints <foreign>ne</foreign> as clear, but none of it is discernible in the scanned estampage, and at least part of it must be broken off. Fleet’s restoration seems a bit long compared to the earlier lines. </note>

                     <note>Since we now know that <foreign>pādānuddhyāta</foreign> does not normally mean “meditating at the feet of”, I think Fleet's restoration must be discarded. Instead, I suggest <foreign>vr̥ddhāpacāyināṁ</foreign> on the basis of <ref target="CalE04-Kopparam-Pulakesin2.xml">CalE04</ref>, but there are other possibilities such as <foreign>sādhubhaktānāṁ</foreign>, etc.</note>

                     <note>Fleet’s suggestion does not seem very plausible. Compare <foreign>aśvamedhāvabhr̥tha-snāna-pavitrī-kr̥ta-vapuṣāṁ</foreign> in numerous later Cālukya plates. All this would probably not have fit in the space at the end of l5 and beginning of l6, but something shorter may have, e.g. <foreign>aśvamedha-pavitrī-kr̥ta-vapuṣāṁ</foreign>. The problem is that this restoration is too similar to the compound with <foreign>pavitrī-kr̥ta-śarīraḥ</foreign> below, though that one is for Pulikeśin I, while this is for the dynasty as a whole.</note>

                     <note>The first character is indistinct in the scan but could well be the right-hand part of <foreign>yā</foreign> (most of the right limb, plus a vowel mark bending down on the right-hand side), and <foreign>-yāgā°</foreign> seems to be much more likely in view of related plates.</note>

<lb 
n="8" break="no"/>tyāśrayaḥ</lem>
                     <note>While Fleet’s restoration is perfectly plausible, it is not necessarily accurate in every detail. Line 8 begins with an indent of 3 to 4 characters because of the binding hole, and while no vestiges are visible in the scanned facsimile to the left of the hole, it is possible that <foreign>sa</foreign> was in fact inscribed there. Moreover, Fleet apparently used this restoration as a basis for estimating the length of the lacunae at the ends of other lines, but it seems possible that each of those lacunae are in fact a few characters longer.</note>
                  </app>

                     <note>The characters Fleet tentatively reads as <foreign>ḷāla</foreign> are wholly indiscernible in the scan; the following <foreign>ha</foreign> (which Fleet prints as clear) is also unclear and could plausibly be <foreign>h</foreign>, <foreign>ph</foreign>, <foreign>ḍh</foreign> or <foreign>ṣ</foreign> with <foreign>a</foreign> or <foreign>ā</foreign>. For the last, partially extant character he notes that it “must be” <foreign>c</foreign>, <foreign>ḍ</foreign>, <foreign>d</foreign>, <foreign>p</foreign>, <foreign>ph</foreign>, <foreign>m</foreign>, <foreign>ṣ</foreign> or <foreign>h</foreign>, and he proposes <foreign>nāmadheya-grāmaṁ</foreign> for the lacuna (or for the remainder after the partial character). In the scan, the partial character looks likely to be <foreign>va</foreign>, which Fleet for some reason does not mention as a possibility. Perhaps something about <foreign>suvarṇṇa</foreign> rather than the name of a village? It also seems likely that the type of <foreign>mahādāna</foreign> would have been specified before the word. Moreover, if a village was mentioned here, I would expect boundaries and prerogatives, so I think Fleet’s restoration is unlikely. But then of course the extant unintelligible string needs to be interpreted; it could still be a place name, but in the locative, saying where the donation ceremony took place. (The extant <foreign>su</foreign> could even be the ending of that locative, in which case of course there is no <foreign>suvarṇṇa</foreign>.)</note>

                     <note>I see no <foreign>r</foreign> in the scan, but Fleet may have had a clearer reading. I assume <foreign>vacca</foreign> is a vernacular form of <foreign>vatsa</foreign>; reading <foreign>vaccha</foreign> may also be possible.</note>

                     <note>Fleet estimates the lacuna at 20 characters. This seems excessive: in the previous line there are about 15 characters across the same span. Also, <foreign>mahā-patha</foreign> (which Fleet prints as clear) is not visible at all in the scan. I do not know how clearly he could see these characters, but perhaps the end may rather have been <foreign>mahā-pātakais saṁyuktas syāt</foreign>.</note>

Fleet translates <q>which effects the tranquillity of the best of the twice-born.</q> This is possible, with the commonplace purport that this king protects peace and the status quo, so the priesthood can feel safe. However, it involves an inelegant compound construction, and I expect <foreign>śānti</foreign> to have a ritual connotation when mentioned next to <foreign>dvija</foreign>s. In this case, as translated above, the king’s arm may stand metonymically for the king himself, and the message may be that there are expert ritualists in charge of the metaphysical protection of the king and thus the kingdom from adversities. Finally, there may be a more loaded interpretation intended, and perhaps implied by the literal meaning of <foreign>harṣa-viccheda</foreign> earlier in the verse: perhaps the propitiatory rituals were performed against his arm, to prevent its excessive aggression, and it is the result of this propitiation that this arm is now the protector, rather than the destroyer of the world.</note></p>

         <div type="commentary">
<p>The plate begins with two short marginal lines distinct from the body text. Fleet does not read the mangala symbol (unclear, apparently a dextrorse spiral resembling a figure 9) in the top left corner and reads svasti (slightly above the level of l2 but well below the level of l1 in the body) at the beginning of l1 and before śrī. I believe śrī belongs with the mangala symbol in the marginal field. In this way the first three lines of the body text have a straight vertical margin just to the right of the hole; the subsequent lines begin further to the left, near the edge of the plate.</p>
<p n="2">In verse 1, I have some doubts about abhinna, though I do not have a good alternative suggestion, unless -tābhinna is to be emended to -tād bhinna (or read as tobhinna and emended to todbhinna). Could the text be vikhātābhinna, he dug up the entire fundament of hell for [=in search of] the surface of the earth? But a dative tatpuruṣa would be really unusual. An autopsy would be helpful here.</p>
<p n="5-8">How could this passage work? We certainly want something like calukyānāṁ vaṁśe saṁbhūtaḥ at some point, and if …ṣāṁ in l6 still qualifies the dynasty (and the preceding lacuna can be filled up as I suggested above), then this must come at the end of l6. Or perhaps kulam alaṁkariṣṇuḥ instead of vaṁśe saṁbhūtaḥ. But Pulikeśin I also ought to be introduced at the end of l6, and the space is simply not enough.</p>
<p>There are only three pādas to stanza 2.</p>
