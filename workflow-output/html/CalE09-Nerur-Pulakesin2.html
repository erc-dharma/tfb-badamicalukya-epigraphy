         <p>Halantas. The halanta M is a slightly reduced and simplified form; instead of a line
            above, it has the left arm extended into a circular stroke resembling an i mātrā but
            open on the right bottom. The halanta N looks like a full-sized regular na.</p>
         <p>Original punctuation. All punctuation marks (unless otherwise noted) are double verticals.

               <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>murāreḥ</i></span> is a much more likely restoration.&nbsp;As Fleet agrees, the subject must be a lost word
               meaning “the form”, and it is easily conceivable that <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>loka-bharttuḥ</i></span> is in apposition to the possessor of that “form” in the genitive. The line may have
               run something like <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>praśamita-ripu-śakti kroḍa-rūpaṁ murāreḥ</i></span>, but I prefer not to show such a conjectural restoration in the text.</span> <br> <sup class="linenumberapp">2</sup> <span class="lemma">vi[–]tābhinna</span> ◇  <span class="reading">vi<span class="notBold">(</span>ghā<span class="notBold">)</span>tābhinna</span><span class="tooltip"> JFF<span class="tooltiptext">Fleet 1879</span></span> <span>• The gap does not seem to be wide enough for <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>ghā</i></span> (unless it was compressed horizontally), although there may have been three vertical
               strokes in this glyph. From the vestiges, the consonant <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>p</i></span> seems more likely, but <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>vipāta</i></span> is not attested, though <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>vi-pat</i></span> “burst asunder” is. The vowel may well be <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>ā</i></span>, though <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>o</i></span> and <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>ī</i></span> are also quite conceivable. See the commentary for further speculation.</span> —  <sup class="linenumberapp">2</sup> <span class="lemma">-bhuja-[⏑⏑⏑––]</span><span class="tooltip"> JFF<span class="tooltiptext">Fleet 1879</span></span> <span>• The lacuna may be restored along the lines of <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>bala-gurutvā</i></span>, again too conjectural to show in the edition.</span> <br> <sup class="linenumberapp">3</sup> <span class="lemma">bāhu[ḥ||]</span> ◇  <span class="reading">bāhu[r]</span><span class="tooltip"> JFF<span class="tooltiptext">Fleet 1879</span></span> <br> <sup class="linenumberapp">4</sup> <span class="lemma">a<span class="notBold">(</span>ne<span class="notBold">)</span>[ka-rāja-parājayopārjjita]-</span><span class="tooltip"> JFF<span class="tooltiptext">Fleet 1879</span></span> <span>• Fleet prints <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>ne</i></span> as clear, but none of it is discernible in the scanned estampage, and at least part
               of it must be broken off. Fleet’s restoration seems a bit long compared to the earlier
               lines. </span> <br> <sup class="linenumberapp">5</sup> <span class="lemma">-<span class="notBold">(</span>g<span class="notBold">)</span>[u]<span class="notBold">(</span>r<span class="notBold">)</span>[u]-[?6+]</span> ◇  <span class="reading">-<span class="notBold">(</span>guru<span class="notBold">)</span>-[pādānuddhyātānāṁ]</span><span class="tooltip"> JFF<span class="tooltiptext">Fleet 1879</span></span> <span>• Since we now know that <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>pādānuddhyāta</i></span> does not normally mean “meditating at the feet of”, I think Fleet’s restoration must
               be discarded. Instead, I suggest <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>vr̥ddhāpacāyināṁ</i></span> on the basis of <a href="https://github.com/erc-dharma/tfb-badamicalukya-epigraphy">CalE04</a>, but there are other possibilities such as <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>sādhubhaktānāṁ</i></span>, etc.</span> <br> <sup class="linenumberapp">6</sup> <span class="lemma">[?5+]ṣāṁ</span> ◇  <span class="reading">[?3+]-[yaju]ṣāṁ</span><span class="tooltip"> JFF<span class="tooltiptext">Fleet 1879</span></span> <span>• Fleet’s suggestion does not seem very plausible. Compare <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>aśvamedhāvabhr̥tha-snāna-pavitrī-kr̥ta-vapuṣāṁ</i></span> in numerous later Cālukya plates. All this would probably not have fit in the space
               at the end of l5 and beginning of l6, but something shorter may have, e.g.&nbsp;<span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>aśvamedha-pavitrī-kr̥ta-vapuṣāṁ</i></span>. The problem is that this restoration is too similar to the compound with <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>pavitrī-kr̥ta-śarīraḥ</i></span> below, though that one is for Pulikeśin I, while this is for the dynasty as a whole.</span> <br> <sup class="linenumberapp">7</sup> <span class="lemma"><span class="notBold">(</span>yā<span class="notBold">)</span>gāvabhr̥tha</span> ◇  <span class="reading">ga[ṁ]gāvabhr̥tha</span><span class="tooltip"> JFF<span class="tooltiptext">Fleet 1879</span></span> <span>• The first character is indistinct in the scan but could well be the right-hand part
               of <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>yā</i></span> (most of the right limb, plus a vowel mark bending down on the right-hand side),
               and <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>-yāgā°</i></span> seems to be much more likely in view of related plates.</span> —  <sup class="linenumberapp">7–8</sup> <span class="lemma">[tasyātmajaḥ srī-sa-]&#xD;/tyāśrayaḥ</span><span class="tooltip"> JFF<span class="tooltiptext">Fleet 1879</span></span> <span>• While Fleet’s restoration is perfectly plausible, it is not necessarily accurate
               in every detail. Line 8 begins with an indent of 3 to 4 characters because of the
               binding hole, and while no vestiges are visible in the scanned facsimile to the left
               of the hole, it is possible that <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>sa</i></span> was in fact inscribed there. Moreover, Fleet apparently used this restoration as
               a basis for estimating the length of the lacunae at the ends of other lines, but it
               seems possible that each of those lacunae are in fact a few characters longer.</span> <br> <sup class="linenumberapp">8</sup> <span class="lemma">kuva<span class="notBold">(</span>ḷālaha<span class="notBold">)</span>su [1×][?6+]</span><span class="tooltip"> JFF<span class="tooltiptext">Fleet 1879</span></span> <span>• The characters Fleet tentatively reads as <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>ḷāla</i></span> are wholly indiscernible in the scan; the following <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>ha</i></span> (which Fleet prints as clear) is also unclear and could plausibly be <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>h</i></span>, <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>ph</i></span>, <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>ḍh</i></span> or <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>ṣ</i></span> with <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>a</i></span> or <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>ā</i></span>. For the last, partially extant character he notes that it “must be” <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>c</i></span>, <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>ḍ</i></span>, <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>d</i></span>, <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>p</i></span>, <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>ph</i></span>, <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>m</i></span>, <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>ṣ</i></span> or <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>h</i></span>, and he proposes <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>nāmadheya-grāmaṁ</i></span> for the lacuna (or for the remainder after the partial character). In the scan, the
               partial character looks likely to be <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>va</i></span>, which Fleet for some reason does not mention as a possibility. Perhaps something
               about <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>suvarṇṇa</i></span> rather than the name of a village? It also seems likely that the type of <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>mahādāna</i></span> would have been specified before the word. Moreover, if a village was mentioned here,
               I would expect boundaries and prerogatives, so I think Fleet’s restoration is unlikely.
               But then of course the extant unintelligible string needs to be interpreted; it could
               still be a place name, but in the locative, saying where the donation ceremony took
               place. (The extant <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>su</i></span> could even be the ending of that locative, in which case of course there is no <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>suvarṇṇa</i></span>.)</span> <br> <sup class="linenumberapp">9</sup> <span class="lemma">va<span class="notBold">(</span>cca<span class="notBold">)</span>-</span> ◇  <span class="reading">va<span class="notBold">(</span>rcca<span class="notBold">)</span>-</span><span class="tooltip"> JFF<span class="tooltiptext">Fleet 1879</span></span> <span>• I see no <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>r</i></span> in the scan, but Fleet may have had a clearer reading. I assume <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>vacca</i></span> is a vernacular form of <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>vatsa</i></span>; reading <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>vaccha</i></span> may also be possible.</span> <br> <sup class="linenumberapp">10</sup> <span class="lemma">tatra pa</span><span class="tooltip"> JFF<span class="tooltiptext">Fleet 1879</span></span> <span>• No trace of these characters is visible in my scan.&nbsp;I adopt but Fleet’s reading,
               but suspect that <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>tatrāghāṭāḥ</i></span> may have been engraved, with Fleet’s <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>pa</i></span> being the left half of <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>ghā</i></span>.</span> <br> <sup class="linenumberapp">11</sup> <span class="lemma">-grāme</span><span class="tooltip"> JFF<span class="tooltiptext">Fleet 1879</span></span> <span>• Though the reading is clear, it is also possible that <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>grāmo</i></span> was engraved, with the right-hand part of the vowel marker lost in the lacuna. As
               the line may be concerned with the boundaries of the donated land, a nominative is
               distinctly possible.</span> —  <sup class="linenumberapp">11</sup> <span class="lemma">[?15+] mahā-patha-</span> <span>• Fleet estimates the lacuna at 20 characters. This seems excessive: in the previous
               line there are about 15 characters across the same span.&nbsp;Also, <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>mahā-patha</i></span> (which Fleet prints as clear) is not visible at all in the scan.&nbsp;I do not know how
               clearly he could see these characters, but perhaps the end may rather have been <span class="lang" lang="eng"><i>mahā-pātakais saṁyuktas syāt</i></span>.</span>   </p>

         <h2>Commentary</h2> 
         <p>The plate begins with two short marginal lines distinct from the body text. Fleet
            does not read the mangala symbol (unclear, apparently a dextrorse spiral resembling
            a figure 9) in the top left corner and reads svasti (slightly above the level of l2
            but well below the level of l1 in the body) at the beginning of l1 and before śrī.
            I believe śrī belongs with the mangala symbol in the marginal field. In this way the
            first three lines of the body text have a straight vertical margin just to the right
            of the hole; the subsequent lines begin further to the left, near the edge of the
            plate.</p> 
         <p><sup class="linenumber">2</sup>In verse 1, I have some doubts about abhinna, though I do not have a good alternative
            suggestion, unless-tābhinna is to be emended to-tād bhinna (or read as tobhinna and
            emended to todbhinna). Could the text be vikhātābhinna, he dug up the entire fundament
            of hell for [=in search of] the surface of the earth? But a dative tatpuruṣa would
            be really unusual. An autopsy would be helpful here.</p> 
         <p><sup class="linenumber">5-8</sup>How could this passage work? We certainly want something like calukyānāṁ vaṁśe saṁbhūtaḥ
            at some point, and if …ṣāṁ in l6 still qualifies the dynasty (and the preceding lacuna
            can be filled up as I suggested above), then this must come at the end of l6. Or perhaps
            kulam alaṁkariṣṇuḥ instead of vaṁśe saṁbhūtaḥ. But Pulikeśin I also ought to be introduced
            at the end of l6, and the space is simply not enough.</p> 
         <p>There are only three pādas to stanza 2.</p> </div>
